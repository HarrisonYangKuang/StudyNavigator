# StudyNavigator

StudyNavigator is a simple command-line tool that helps users make and review decisions in a structured way.

It is designed for students who want to slow down their thinking, compare options clearly, and reflect on past choices.

## Features

- Create a new decision with clear goals and options
- Rate impact, cost, risk, and reversibility
- Get a simple recommendation based on weighted scores
- Reflect on past decisions and record outcomes

## How It Works

When creating a new decision, the program asks you to rate:

- Impact on your goal
- Time or effort cost
- Risk level
- How reversible the decision is

Based on these inputs, StudyNavigator calculates a score and gives a recommendation.

You can also reflect on past decisions to see whether your original choice and recommendation were helpful.
